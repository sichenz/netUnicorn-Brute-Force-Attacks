# netUnicorn-Brute-Force-Attacks

This project utilizes PINOT (UCSB network data infrastructure) to extract and simulate a dataset that models off of the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset. This dataset is then utilized to create and train a machine learning model that can detect brute force attacks within networks. The efficiency and accurateness of the model is tested using trustee, in order to ensure maximum performance.
